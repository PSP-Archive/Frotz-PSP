Frotz-PSP

A PSP port of the Frotz Z-Machine interpreter by Stefan Jokisch Et. El. (see
doc/AUTHORS for a complete list).

Port by Norman B. Lancaster (QBRADQ)

INSTALLATION

1. Copy the PSP directory onto the root of your memory stick. This will create
   a PSP/GAME/frotz-psp directory containing the executable.
2. Place story files somewhere on your PSP memory stick. For recent community
   works this will be the .z3 or .z5 file provided by the author. For
   commercial games this will typically be a .DAT file (such as ZORK1.DAT).

STARTING A GAME

1. Start the application as normal for your firmware.
2. When the application starts it will open a file selection dialog allowing
   you to choose the story file you want to play.
    a. If you prefer to auto-load a story file, place said story file on the
       root of your memory stick and name it "story.file". This will be
       automatically loaded and the file select dialog will be skipped.
